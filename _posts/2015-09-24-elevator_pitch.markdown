Here's how one might describe this project in < 1 minute (ie, when making a pitch on an elevator):

* Malaria is costly to business in Mozambique, particularly the many large foreign direct investments  
* But investors and business leaders are hesitant to invest in controlling malara because they're not sure sure what the return on that investment will be, nor do they understand which interventions will be accepted by workers and their families.
* We're trying to quantify the economics benefits of malaria control interventions from a business-owner's or investor's standpoint.
* We're trying to qualify community and individual preferences about malaria control.  
* If we do both of those things well, our work will hopefully facilitate the natural and organic flow of resources to where it is most needed and will be most effective.
