<p>Hi again!</p>

<p>It's me, Pepe, from Swashbuckle.  We exchanged a few emails a couple months ago.  And then I exchanged some, by myself.  Well, I sent them to you, but you never wrote back.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, then the weeks became fortnights (I just learned that word, isn't it cool, it makes me sound British, doesn't it!?), then the fortnights (awesome word!) became months. No reply.</p>

<p>I occasionally would open some of the emails I had sent you, to see if perhaps I had said something offensive, but nope, they were pretty vanilla.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why won't you just give me your data?</h2>

<p>You sounded so excited on the phone. You were like "yeah, let's do this, cool!" and I was like "alright, yeah, great!"  Such positive energy, man!  I was so pumped after our call that I kicked a baby!</p>

<p>(Don't worry, it wasn't some stranger's baby.  This was a baby that's been hanging around my house for a while, acting weird and stuff.)</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Imagine, you and me, playing the data-for-in-kind-analysis marimba together, forever.</span>



<p>Anyway, so, what happened?  I mean, did you meet someone else to whom you're gonna give your data?  Am I being overbearing?  Underbearing?  Do you want me to better balance my bearing?</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Do you want to talk about it?</h2>

<p>Listen, I get it.  These things happen.  Sometimes people offer data, and then they act like big old jerks.  C'est la vie, right?  No big deal.  </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Don't worry, I'll never hang you out to dry.  (Get it?  Cause the photo...)</span>


<p>But, do you think we could, you know, just have a cup of coffee together and talk about it?  I know you're really busy and stuff, but I just want some closure, you know?  I mean if you're really busy, it's okay, that's fine, no worries.  Yeah, I'm pretty busy too.</p>

<p>I miss you.</p>
