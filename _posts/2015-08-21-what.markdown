## Title 
Foreign investments to finance malaria elimination: evidence from the south of Mozambique

## Description

Elimination of malaria from one of the endemic countries with the highest burden of disease, Mozambique, will require, in addition to biological feasibility, at least two conditions: secured high and long term investments and a profound knowledge of individuals and community preferences over current and potential new malaria elimination tools. The first condition will prevent malaria elimination to fail due to lack of funding and the second will guarantee compliance with the strategies adopted.  

High level funding could be guaranteed by foreign for profit investments, currently high in the country and focused on activities such as the construction of infrastructures in the capital city Maputo. In order to push foreign capitals towards malaria elimination it is crucial to prove that malaria has a strong impact in reducing economic growth, meaning that if malaria would be eliminated this will potentially translate into high economic returns. In addition, the knowledge of community’s preferences over malaria elimination tools is a prerequisite itself and may ensure potential investors of the high probability of elimination success.  

This project aims at exploring the feasibility of foreign for profit investments to finance partially or entirely a malaria elimination programme in Mozambique through a transdisciplinary approach to tackle several research questions associated with this complex topic: characterization of current foreign investment in country; interest and availability of foreign investors to finance malaria elimination; burden of malaria among workers and its impact on productivity and, thus, on economic growth; workers’ and community preferences on malaria control tools.
